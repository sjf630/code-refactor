# code-refactor: Horiseon

## Description

This project was for the purpose of learning to refactor html and css code to make it easier to read reducing repetition and making it more understandable and easy to follow. Some changes were made in the semantics of the html and style sheets to achieve this goal.

I built this project to practice user friendly code and improve my knowledge and skill of recognizing redundancy. Primarily, my focus was to improve functionality in my coding.
Practicing these skills will allow for fluidity and comprehension of html and css in the future.
This project has taught me to recognize repetitive and unnecessary elements, to better organize html elements, and has helped me identify the areas I need to focus on to become a better web developer moving forward.


## Credits

I utilized peer collaboration and tutoring with classmate Thahn "Ted" Doan, as well as, W3 schools, youtube, and my tutor, Mazin.
